# materials-characterization-data-analysis
 Python modules to analyze charecterization data.
Welcome to the materials-charecterization-data-analysis repository. This repository currently includes several modules to analyze PPMS, AFM, and XRD data at Penn State. This repository is currently maintained by one individual, but if you would like to get involved please reach out through the discussions board or to my email (mrm6464@psu.edu). 
The goal of this project is to provide a tool that gives a first pass at materials charecterization data. It is not intended to be the sole analysis you use, as there are much more sophisticated softwares out there that can do this.
